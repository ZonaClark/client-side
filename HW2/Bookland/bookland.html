      var book1 = ["James Joyce", "A portrait of the artist as a young man", "This book is a fictional re-creation of the Irish writer's own life and early environment. The experiences of the novel's young hero, unfold in astonishingly vivid scenes that seem freshly recalled from life and provide a powerful portrait of the coming of age of a young man of unusual intelligence, sensitivity and character."];
      var book2 = ["E. M. Forster", "A room with a view", "This work displays an unusually perceptive view of British society in the early 20th century.It is a social comedy set in Florence, Italy, and Surrey, England. Its heroine, Lucy Honeychurch, struggling against straitlaced Victorian attitudes of arrogance, narroe mindedness and sobbery, falls in love - while on holiday in Italy - with the socially unsuitable George Emerson."];

      var book4 = ["Isabel Allende", "Of love and shadows", "The whole world of Irene Beltran, a young reporter in Chile at the time of the dictatorship, is destroyed when she discovers a series of killings carried out by government soldiers. With the help of a photographer, Francisco Leal, and risking her life, she tries to come up with evidence against the dictatorship."];
